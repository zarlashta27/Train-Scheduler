# Train-Scheduler

7th Homework Assignment for GW Coding Bootcamp - Incorporate Firebase to host train arrival and departure data

Overview
In this assignment, I have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The  app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
